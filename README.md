You can also change the theme in the application and go to the about the application screen written in DivKit.
The application stores data on the server as well as in a local database. The lack of Internet does not affect the operation of the application. The data is loaded from the database, and when the data changes, it changes in the database.  With the advent of the Internet, data is synchronized and the most up-to-date data is stored in the local database and on the server.
Accessibility is supported in the application.
